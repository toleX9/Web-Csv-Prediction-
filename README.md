# Dataset Processing and Prediction

This project includes a Python script to:
1. Download a dataset from a web page.
2. Process and save up to 200 rows for further analysis.
3. Perform linear regression to predict a target variable.

## Features
- Automatically downloads datasets from a given URL.
- Saves processed data to `For_Prediction.csv`.
- Displays dataset structure and unique classes in the target column.
- Uses `scikit-learn` for linear regression modeling.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/toleX9/Web-Csv-Prediction-.git
cd Web-Csv-Prediction-

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### 3.  Setup Configuration
If your project requires specific configurations, you can modify the config.yaml file. It contains essential settings for the script, such as the dataset URL and any parameters related to the prediction model.

### 4. Run the setup script

To automatically set up your environment and configurations, run the setup.sh script:
```bash
 ./setup.sh

### 5. Run the Script

This will download the dataset, process it, and perform the linear regression prediction.
```bash 
python3 dataset.py
